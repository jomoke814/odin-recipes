# odin-recipes

My first project on Odin curriculum course:https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes.
I used all my html knowledge that I have acquire since I started learning on Odin project to practice and also got to use git. In this project I built a basic recipe website. The website consisted of a main index page with links to a few recipes and didn't have css yet. Later in the course I added some css styles:https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-css-foundations in the website its not perfect but its decent.
