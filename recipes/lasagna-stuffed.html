    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 (14 ounce) cans tomato sauce, divided</li>
        <li>18 piece (blank)s jumbo pasta shells</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) container whole-milk ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, zested and juiced</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to follow:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; add 1/2 of the ground beef with a big pinch of salt and pepper and cook until the beef is seared and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Remove beef from the pan and cook the remainder. Set all meat aside.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to medium-low and add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the onion. Saute until aromatic, about 2 minutes. Add tomato paste and oregano, followed by the ground beef and one jar of sauce. Stir to combine and reduce to a simmer. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add shells and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Strain; feel free to reserve some pasta water to add to the sauce if you like.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in another pan over medium heat and add the garlic. Saute until lightly golden. Transfer garlic to a mixing bowl with ricotta, mozzarella, spinach, basil, and lemon zest and juice. Add salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Pour remaining tomato sauce into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spoon the cheese mixture into the shells followed by the meat mixture. As you finish stuffing each shell, place it in the sauce. Top with Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the shells are hot in the center and the mozzarella cheese is melted and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
